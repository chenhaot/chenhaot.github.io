How do I work with you?</strong></p><ul><li><p>If you are considering doing a postdoc with me, please email me with your CV, two names of references, and an optional one-page research statement. All the postdocs I have supervised so far have successfully landed tenure-track positions at R1 universities (check out <a href=https://chicagohai.github.io/>my group website</a>), and I always have openings for talented postdocs.</p></li><li><p>If you are applying for PhD programs at the University of Chicago, please mention me specifically in your application. It is optional to drop me an email with your CV to let me know that you applied (put `GRADAPP-20XX&rsquo; in the subject). I will reply if I think that there is a potentially good fit.<br>In the application process for 2024 Fall, I am going to experiment with a new process for evaluating applications. After an initial round of interview, I will have weekly research meetings with the prospective students for four weeks to determine the fit with me as a PhD student.</p></li><li><p>If you are considering a master degree, we have a <a href=https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu/page/pre-doctoral-ms-computer-science>pre-doctoral master program</a> with an emphasis on research. I mostly take master students in that program. I highly recommend this program if you have limited access to research opportunities.</p></li><li><p>For short-term visits, e.g., summer interns, send me an email with your CV and transcripts (put `INTERN-20XX&rsquo; in the subject). I prefer students who can be physicially in Chicago. I will consider virtual visits in exceptional cases.</p></li></ul><p><strong>I want to work with you, and I&rsquo;m currently a student at the University of Chicago. How do I do that?</strong></p><p>Feel free to send me an email with your CV and transcripts! If you do not hear back from me within a week, please follow up with a reminder.</p><p>Prerequisites include math/CS backgrounds (e.g., algorithms, probability, statistics, and linear algebra), programming skills (e.g., Python, Java, C/C++, and JavaScript), and interests in thinking about AI, humans, and/or their intersection.</p><p>It is helpful if you have taken a course in machine learning or natural language processing, or demonstrate a strong understanding through writing/coding in blogs/github repos. But it is more important that you show a passion towards research!</p></main><footer><hr>Â© Chenhao Tan 2025 (made with <a href=https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/>Hugo XMin</a>) | <a href=https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/>Github</a> | <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KGMaP18AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a> | <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/chenhaotan.bsky.social>Bluesky</a> | <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenhao-tan-2a446316/>LinkedIn</a></footer></body></html>
