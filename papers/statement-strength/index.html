For example, international relations can be strained by how the media in one country describes an event in another; and papers can be rejected because they overstate or understate their findings. It is thus important to understand the effects of statement strength. A first step is to be able to distinguish between strong and weak statements. However, even this problem is understudied, partly due to a lack of data. Since strength is inherently relative, {em revisions} of texts that make claims are a natural source of data on strength differences. In this paper, we introduce a corpus of sentence-level revisions from academic writing. We also describe insights gained from our annotation efforts for this task.</p><p>[<a href=/data/arxiv_statement_strength.zip>Data</a>(<a href=/data/statement-strength/README.txt>README</a>)][<a href=/pubs/statement-strength.pdf>PDF</a>][<a href=/pubs/acl-statement.pdf>Slides</a>]</p><p>@inproceedings{tan+lee:14,<br>
