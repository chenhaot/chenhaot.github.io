(Un)expected correlations between (de-)emphasis and recurrence of discussion points in consequential U.S. economic policy meetings</h2><p>Chenhao Tan, <a href=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee>Lillian Lee</a>.<br>Presented in Text As Data 2016.</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>In meetings where important decisions get made, what items receive more attention may influence the outcome. We examine how different types of rhetorical (de-)emphasis — including hedges, superlatives, and contrastive conjunctions — correlate with what gets revisited later, controlling for item frequency and speaker. Our data consists of transcripts of recurring meetings of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC), where important aspects of U.S. monetary policy are decided on. Surprisingly, we find that words appearing in the context of hedging, which is usually considered a way to express uncertainty, are more likely to be repeated in subsequent meetings, while strong emphasis indicated by superlatives has a slightly negative effect on word recurrence in subsequent meetings. We also observe interesting patterns in how these effects vary depending on social factors such as status and gender of the speaker. For instance, the positive effects of hedging are more pronounced for female speakers than for male speakers.</p><p>[<a href=/pubs/fomc-de-emphasis.pdf>PDF</a>]
