Smith</a>.<br>In Proceedings of The Web Conference (WWW'2018).</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>Political speeches and debates play an important role in shaping the images of politicians, and the public often relies on media outlets to select bits of political communication from a large pool of utterances. It is an important research question to understand what factors impact this selection process.</p><p>To quantitatively explore the selection process, we build a three- decade dataset of presidential debate transcripts and post-debate coverage. We first examine the effect of wording and propose a binary classification framework that controls for both the speaker and the debate situation. We find that crowdworkers can only achieve an accuracy of 60% in this task, indicating that media choices are not entirely obvious. Our classifiers outperform crowdworkers on average, mainly in primary debates. We also compare important factors from crowdworkers&rsquo; free-form explanations with those from data-driven methods and find interesting differences. Few crowdworkers mentioned that &ldquo;context matters&rdquo;, whereas our data show that well-quoted sentences are more distinct from the previous utterance by the same speaker than less-quoted sentences. Finally, we examine the aggregate effect of media preferences towards different wordings to understand the extent of fragmentation among media outlets. By analyzing a bipartite graph built from quoting behavior in our data, we observe a decreasing trend in bipartisan coverage.</p><p>[<a href=/pubs/debate_quotes/debate-quotes.pdf>PDF</a>][<a href=/pubs/debate_quotes/supplementary.pdf>Supplementary material</a>][<a href=/data/debate-quotes/debate_quotes.zip>Data</a>(<a href=/data/debate-quotes/README.txt>README</a>)][<a href=/pubs/debate_quotes/www_slides.pdf>Slides</a>]</p><p><img src=https://chenhaot.com/pubs/debate_quotes/simi.png alt="similarity with turns."></p><p>@inproceedings{tan+peng+smith:18,<br>
