Abstract: 
Most real-world document collections involve various types of metadata, such as author, source, and date, and yet the most commonly-used approaches to modeling text corpora ignore this information. While specialized models have been developed for particular applications, few are widely used in practice, as customization typically requires derivation of a custom inference algorithm. In this paper, we build on recent advances in variational inference methods and propose a general neural framework, based on topic models, to enable flexible incorporation of metadata and allow for rapid exploration of alternative models. Our approach achieves strong performance, with a manageable tradeoff between perplexity, coherence, and sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our framework through an exploration of a corpus of articles about US immigration."><meta property="og:image" content="https://chenhaot.github.io//images/web_circle_small.jpg"><meta property="twitter:card" content="summary"><meta property="twitter:url" content="https://chenhaot.github.io/papers/neural-topic-model-metadata/"><meta property="twitter:title" content="neural topic model metadata | Welcome to Chenhao Tan's Personal Website!"><meta property="twitter:description" content="Neural Models for Documents with Metadata
