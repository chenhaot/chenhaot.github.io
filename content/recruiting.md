summary: A short description for recruiting.

I am working more and more on AI & Scientific Discovery these days. To attract more relevant candidates, I posted this [X post](https://x.com/ChenhaoTan/status/1985422996786602140).

To elaborate on this, I would love to do more:

* System building that develops research agents to improve scientific research at all stages.
* In-depth collaboration with students who can "speak" multiple languages, both in a particular domain and in computer science/AI.
* Theoretical research that explores the collaboration dynamics between humans and AI as well as new incentives that can lead to desirable equilibria.

Feel free to email me if you have questions. I am also planning to write a longer [blog](https://substack.com/@cichicago) later.
