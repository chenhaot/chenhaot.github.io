summary: a short history of my life.

I moved to the University of Chicago after 3.5 wonderful years at Boulder. Before Boulder, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [University of Washington][uw], working with [Noah Smith][noah_smith] for a year.
Prior to that, I spent wonderful years at Ithaca working with [Lillian Lee][lillian_lee] and [many others][collaborators],
and obtained a PhD degree in [Computer Science][cornell_cs] at [Cornell University][cornell].
Originally, I am from [Jingdezhen, China][jingdezhen_wiki] and lived in Beijing for four years while studying [Computer Science][tsinghua_cs] and [Economics][tsinghua_econ] at [Tsinghua University][tsinghua].    



You are here probably because you are interested in learning about life trajectories. I have a [paper](/papers/multi-community) on that subject, and the main takeaway is "People, unlike trees, thrive by relocation".

Chenhao Tan is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Chicago, and directs the Chicago Human+AI Lab. He earned his PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University and dual bachelor's degrees in computer science and economics from Tsinghua University. His research focuses on human-centered AI, communication & intelligence, and AI alignment. His work has been covered by major news media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. He also won a Sloan research fellowship, an NSF CAREER award, an NSF CRII award, a Google research scholar award, research awards from Amazon, IBM, JP Morgan, and Salesforce, a Facebook fellowship, and a Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges award.

History of research description on the homepage:

#### since 12/15/2025


My research aims to develop the best AI for humans. I am mainly interested in the following problems.

* AI & Scientific Discovery. We aim to 1)
  develop research agents to improve scientific research at all stages (e.g., [idea
  explorer](https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/idea-explorer) and [hypothesis generation](https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/hypothesis-generation)); 2) work with domain scientists (check out
  [AI and Science online seminar](https://ai-scientific-discovery.github.io/)); and 3) investigate theories on scientist-AI collaboration, both on
  incentives and tacit knowledge.
* Understanding and improving LLMs. The most direct application of AI in science for me is to AI
  itself. We aim to understand model behavior through both prompting science and mechanistic
  interpretability (e.g., [concept incongruence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14905) and [MechEvalAgents](https://tinyurl.com/MechEvalAgents)). I am also interested in novel ways that LLMs can unlock human understanding
  (e.g., [communication games](https://hrsimulator.communicationgames.ai/)).
* AI & Democratic Processes. AI is reshaping how we can produce and consume information. In addition
  to scientific discovery, I am interested in how AI will or can influence democratic
  processes. We are actively working on CivicChat (stay tuned).

#### 01/01/2025 --- 12/14/2025

My research brings together social sciences and machine learning to develop the best AI for humans. The applications that I am most interested in are 1) scientific discoveries, 2) healthcare, and 3) governance and democratic processes (ordered by random coin flips).   

The central question of my current interest lies in how we can build an effective communication protocol between humans and AI. Here are some example problems that I think will contribute to this question:

* Specification: How can we help AI understand human goals and help humans specify their goals? Prompting and reinforcement learning from human feedback are the main paradigms right now, but what about goals that cannot be easily described or elicited through human preferences? Examples include [data-driven hypothesis generation](https://chicagohai.github.io/hypogenic-demo/) and [decision-focused summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06896).
* Complementary AI: How can we develop AI that accounts for human intuitions/biases and complement human intelligence? This requires us to model human intuitions/biases and address them constructively. We have done some prior work on the important role of human similarity judgments in [case-based explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04809) and generally [machine explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04092). But we will need fundamental breakthroughs in behavioral sciences, which in turn inform AI modeling/inference.
* Interpretability: How can we make sense of (powerful) AI that is much better than humans? I am most interested in interpretability for expanding human knowledge (e.g., in scientific discoveries) and for improving the controllability of AI. It is important to explore opportunities in the absence of identifiability.

In general, goals matter more to me than the specific problem or method. For instance, while hallucination is not among the above problems, I spend a lot of time thinking about hallucination at Abridge, as non-factual statements are very problematic for generating clinical notes in healthcare.

#### Unknown beginning of time --- 12/31/2024

My research brings together social sciences and machine learning to develop the best AI for humans. Specifically, my work aims to enable effective human-AI interaction by

1. Understanding human decision making through language. We analyze large amounts of textual data to unfold the connection between language and decisions in two directions. In one direction, we leverage natural experiments to understand how language shapes human decisions (e.g., <a href="/papers/changemyview.html">what makes effective persuasion</a> and [language of bargaining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07117)). In the other direction, we examine explanations of human decisions to identify their biases.


2. Generating human-centered explanations. [Our work](https://chenhaot.com/papers/human-predictions.html) shows that current methods of generating explanations for AI predictions fail to improve human-AI decision making. We develop [a novel theoretical framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04092) to show that the missing link is to model human interpretation of AI explanations. We thus build algorithms to [align AI explanations with human intuitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04809) and demonstrate substantial improvements in human performance.
3. Developing novel paradigms of human-AI interaction. We explore additional possibilities that humans and AI can complement each other in three directions: 1) appropriate and effective [delegation](https://chenhaot.com/papers/conditional-delegation.html) to AI; 2) [decision-focused summarization](https://chenhaot.com/papers/decision-focused-summarization.html), a novel formulation of the classic NLP task to identify the most relevant information to support decision making; and 3) [few-shot learning from human explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08042) so that humans can effectively improve large language models (LLMs).
