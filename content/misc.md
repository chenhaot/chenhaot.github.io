I attended CAOSS (Computational and Online Social Science) 2012 in NYC. I wrote a brief summary containing the works covered in the workshop. \[[PDF][caoss_pdf]\]   

I lived in [Telluride House][telluride_wiki] for four years. It has been quite an enriching experience to live with people from various backgrounds.

My hometown is [Jingdezhen][jingdezhen_wiki]. It is known as the "Porcelain Capital" for producing quality pottery for 1700 years.
